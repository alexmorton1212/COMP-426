## COMP 426: Modern Web Programming

This repository includes my coursework from COMP 426 at UNC-Chapel Hill taught by Ketan Mayer-Patel (KMP), and assignments were designed by KMP and other constributors.

The course focused on developing applications for the World Wide Web including both client-side and server-side programming with emphasis on Model-View-Controller architecture, AJAX, RESTful Web services, and database interaction.

<b>This is just to keep my work organized. Follow the UNC-CH honor code if you choose to look at this for your own coursework.</b>
